prose default width is actually decently wide, its the div aboves flex justify-center thats causing the width issue
I want text to wrap, but I don't think I can because of injected html, not related to prose classname
the container makes its max width equal to the longest word

Google recrawls 404ed pages, shouldn't tap into crawl budget.. I should return 410 on /i/ pages, I was able to submit a takedown old request
I can't preload the images in Next cause of the temporary auth creds, I would need to get request, get a lambda,
the lambda would then return a appropriately sized images
I just need to getServerSideProps()
4/15-16 was sick

Quill is defined with max-w-4xl, while the blog post is maxWidth: '100ch'
My nested keyToImage function repeated forever; the console in chrome devtools appeared to not work until chrome restart

In prod I tried logging in twice and failed to reach Cognito, refreshed, tried again, worked.. Maybe because was during a redeploy?
keyToImage function was repeating forever when data wasn't right, I added a failsafe but it was too strict, currently have a weak one

'topic' naming in edit existed while it was called 'title' in [id]&[topic], changed to title
focus outline doesn't seem to work on navbar, is because errthangs getting rerendered?
path [id] still exists, I just made the links in /users and /index forward to a specific topic topics[0] or stringed
I had a link and click event in /users.. deleted click event
Also was necessary to use () in string + conditional statement.
google search brings up title with dashes because thats what it used to be, fixed.
Whats up with all the unused /chunks/static next js? as well as it getting crawled by google - is that detracting from crawl budge?

Implemented serverless image handler, used gui to spin up cloudformation. I don't know if this is even beneficial...
It appears <Image /> still  - is defaulting to <img>; next Image doesn't work with injected html
Window/document btoa, all available in the useEffect hook.

Amplify mandates folder prefixes on upload, I just have to address them in the JSON key: property.
I could slice out the first image, and render it a as a Next Image, since that is the one that matters for content shift
Changed env variables in Seed, didn't immediatly take effect, forced redeploy, worked.
The reconstructed event seems to have charge and details false while the account property seems to say they exist.
account_updated isn't getting called
gifs dont work with serverless image handler..

Can the alt tag be exploited? Am I sanitizing the text as the very last process
front end saves the string s3 first save has s3 url with id, converts to 
App is no longer converting to keys, but if keys still exist, it will convert them to str
4/24
I could make the alt descriptions stay so visible in quill but then be removed after receiving from dynamo.
However it was easier to just have them disappear on save.

/LeaveComment is using reviewRole, so now reviewRole has some extra permissions
Added ctrl alt b, v for highlighting html open/closes

twitter: @_gty__ failed to save in public string
reminder - s3 bucket is not in cloudformation, do I add it to yaml... I dunno

Code license? I don't use anyone else code do I?

It seems like I might be able to use the user's id with the key on the image request
I should implement uploading to protected, if this works with image handler - it does not
seem to work by simply adding the identity id to key
Cloudfront doesn't have the IAM, because its going to api gateway, going to lambda, to s3

uploading images >5mb seems to fail, but this wasn't always the case. Tried to go back to aws-amplify 
instead of storage specific, kept getting a 'steam' error
Uploading images was a CORS exposedHeaders - Etag

Previous notes -I can get preferred username out of the IDjwttoken.atob

Highlight is working but only in blog edit where I declare it, it also looks like shit, I'd rather
just paste in code, and it keeps colors across pages.
How does pasting in text with color work .. with Quill
highlighting doesn't work in prod
I don't want to use prose because of formatting error, but I kinda have to cause nothing has formatting otherwise...
I guess I could format it myself if need be

In /topics im updating a topicObj in dynamodb without doing anything to the object, is this a vulnerability?
Could someone said whatever obj they want to the database? What could that do..
That Lambda proxy response... gotta be right, "" + var didn't work for body, had to use JSON.stringify()
Didn't need next image, just used image with height and width to prerender

Active/PPM glitch - opening phone makes user active, can't edit PPM while active, have no way of going inactive
except dynamodb - if I remove, You could change price mid call, and charge would use the new price

hoyl fucking shit the Property 'idToken' does not exist on type 'CognitoUserSession' is because I was getting
the object instead of the function which I guess is proper?
5/18
reverted to yaml
the images dont work cause of the keyToImage bracket parsing function
5/20
I don't think you need to delete the photos, storage can only be accessed through cloudfront, and 
you need to know the image key, which is a uuid.. so you couldnt try crawling or anything
