prose default width is actually decently wide, its the div aboves flex justify-center thats causing the width issue
I want text to wrap, but I don't think I can because of injected html, not related to prose classname
the container makes its max width equal to the longest word

Google recrawls 404ed pages, shouldn't tap into crawl budget.. I should return 410 on /i/ pages, I was able to submit a takedown old request

the lambda would then return a appropriately sized images
I just need to getServerSideProps()
